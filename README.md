## 🚀 Quick Start

### Local Development

1. **Clone or download the files**
   ```bash
   # If you have Git
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd vector-databases-guide
   ```

2. **Serve locally**
   ```bash
   # Using Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Python 2
   python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
   
   # Using Node.js
   npx serve .
   
   # Using PHP
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```

3. **Open browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

### AWS Deployment

#### Option 1: AWS CLI Deployment

```bash
# Create S3 bucket (replace with your unique bucket name)
aws s3 mb s3://your-vector-db-guide-bucket

# Upload files
aws s3 sync . s3://your-vector-db-guide-bucket \
  --exclude "*.git*" \
  --exclude "README.md" \
  --exclude "ToDo.md"

# Enable static website hosting
aws s3 website s3://your-vector-db-guide-bucket \
  --index-document index.html \
  --error-document index.html

# Create CloudFront distribution for better performance
aws cloudfront create-distribution \
  --distribution-config file://cloudfront-config.json
```

#### Option 2: AWS Console Deployment

1. **Create S3 Bucket**:
   - Go to AWS S3 Console
   - Create a new bucket with a unique name
   - Enable static website hosting
   - Upload all files except README.md and ToDo.md

2. **Configure CloudFront**:
   - Create a CloudFront distribution
   - Set the S3 bucket as origin
   - Configure custom error pages to redirect to index.html

3. **Optional: Custom Domain**:
   - Configure Route 53 for custom domain
   - Request SSL certificate through ACM
   - Update CloudFront distribution with custom domain

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### Vector Database Theme
- **Colors**: Matrix green (#00ff41) with blue (#00bfff) accents for a tech-focused feel
- **Typography**: Inter font family for modern, clean appearance
- **Interactions**: Smooth animations and hover effects
- **Accessibility**: High contrast ratios and keyboard navigation support

### User Experience Principles
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Information revealed as needed through decision tree
- **Interactive Learning**: Guided discovery of relevant solutions
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive design that works on all devices
- **Performance**: Optimized for fast loading and smooth interactions

## 🔧 Customization

### Colors
Update CSS custom properties in `styles.css`:
```css
:root {
  --matrix-primary: #00ff41;    /* Primary green */
  --vector-blue: #00bfff;       /* Vector blue accent */
  --matrix-accent: #39ff14;     /* Bright green accent */
  --matrix-dark: #1a1a2e;       /* Dark background */
  /* ... other variables */
}
```

### Content Updates
- **Decision Tree**: Modify the `getResultData()` function in `script.js`
- **Services**: Update the services grid in `index.html`
- **Use Cases**: Edit the use cases section content
- **Resources**: Update links in the resources section

### Adding New Services
1. Add service card to the services section in `index.html`
2. Add service details to `showServiceDetails()` in `script.js`
3. Update decision tree results in `getResultData()`

## 📊 Decision Tree Logic

The decision tree guides users through these key decision points:

1. **Primary Use Case**
   - Semantic Search
   - RAG Applications
   - Recommendation Systems
   - Similarity Matching

2. **Scale & Requirements**
   - Small/Medium Scale (< 1M documents)
   - Enterprise Scale (> 1M documents)
   - Security Requirements
   - Performance Needs

3. **Technology Preferences**
   - Managed Services vs. Custom Solutions
   - Cost Optimization
   - Integration Requirements
